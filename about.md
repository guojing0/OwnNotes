### 关于（About the Site）

我创建[这个网站](http://notes.funnyguo.me/)的目的不仅仅是为了分享笔记，而是希望更多的人可以从这个网站中受益，换而言之，让使用这个网站的人在更短的时间内获取更多的知识。

我相信学习的效率是可以提高的。相比坐在椅子上跟着教师的进度，不如学习经过系统整理的知识，并将它们用于现实的生活当中。

The goal of building [this website](http://notes.funnyguo.me/) is not only to share my study notes, but to help people and to accelerate the speed of learning new knowledges in a shorter time.

I firmly believe that the efficiency of learning can be accelerated. Compared to people sitting on their chairs in a classroom and following the process of teaching, others learning systematized knowledges study faster so they can contribute more to the society.
